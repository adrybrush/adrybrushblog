I drew this picture of Link from Ocarina of Time in 1998 and found it while visiting my parents. I erased my name to keep my blog anonymous~ even though so far I've only told like five friends about it...

I drew this picture a long time ago...a real long time ago...I have that Dave Chappelle Tupac song stuck in my head whenever I look at this picture, check it out. :)
