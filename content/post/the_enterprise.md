This is my first post~ I'm hoping this blog will serve as a place for me to practice my writing and upload stuff I've been drawing. Recently I've been drawing ships from Star Trek.

For people unfamiliar with Star Trek, this drawing is of the Enterprise-D made famous in Star Trek The Next Generation and blown up in a movie called Star Trek Generations... It was captained by Jean-Luc Picard a Frenchman with a British accent. 

This piece was draw in a notebook using a pencil. Later it was traced with a pen and painted with water color and detailed with color pencil. Much more exciting to do than to read about, let me know what you think~
